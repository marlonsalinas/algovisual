# AlgoVisual

## Introduction: 
AlgoVisual was created to be an educational tool to help people visualize how pathfinding algorithms function, while providing satisfying, colorful visuals. This is the repo for the frontend. The backend repo can be found here: https://github.com/marlonsalinas/algovisual-backend

## Techologies used: 
HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, Styled Components, Bootstrap

## Getting started: 
https://serene-euclid-0f4030.netlify.app/

## Unsolved problems: 
Uncommenting bootstrap in the public/index.html file reformats a lot of the app's styling and expands the grid, creating spaces between the nodes.

## Future enhancements: 
Give the user the power to move the source and end node around the grid, allow the user to choose from a selection of algorithms to visualize, allow the user to select different colors for the visuals.
